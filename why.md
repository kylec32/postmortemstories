# Who am I?

Hello I am Kyle. I am a software architect and run the website [LightWeightCoding.tk](https://lightweightcoding.tk). I find the complexities of software interesting and like to understand what makes systems fail (or avoid failure).   

# Why this blog?

As I have read many blogs where companies share post mortems on a failure or issue they have had I have often found nuggets of wisdom that have helped me in my own software design. I wanted to create this website to host all the stories I find across the web as a one stop place to get the latest post mortems. My hope is that as others learn from other's failures we can make our software more stable and provide morevalue to the users of our software. I appreciate all the companies and individuals that humbling post these post mortems for any to read, they help the whole community grow and increase in knowledge.
